COLLABORATION EXCHANGE FUND
==========================================================================

## For A Truly Vibrant Network Of Excellence

Deadlines any year: 15th January – 15th May – 15th September

## Boosting Connections Between TAILOR Partners

The TAILOR network includes many of Europe’s top AI labs, and the TAILOR **Collaboration Exchange Fund** aims to enhance collaboration between [TAILOR partners](https://tailor-network.eu/partners/) by funding mobility of PhD students.

- [Scientific board ->](https://tailor-network.eu/connectivity-fund/connectivity-fund-scientific-board/)


## Research Visits

We support research visits between 1 and 3 months. We will provide additional funding to your organisation that will allow you to focus on doing excellent AI. Both your lab and the host lab must be part of a [TAILOR partner organisation](https://tailor-network.eu/partners/). 

## Great! Can I apply?

The Collaboration Exchange fund is open to all PhD students from one of the [54 TAILOR partners](https://tailor-network.eu/partners/) (for exchanges involving a [TAILOR network member](https://tailor-network.eu/network-members/) or a lab not currently part of the TAILOR network you should apply to the [Connectivity Fund](https://tailor-network.eu/connectivity-fund/)). You need a great idea to do excellent AI research within the broad ara of *Trustworthy AI through Integrating Learning, Optimisation and Reasining*, an invitation letter from your hosting lab, and a letter of support from the main TAILOR scientist of your organisation.

## Research Visits Goals

We are looking for visits that help young researchers gain experience and world-wide recognition by working in excellent labs (scientific step-up). Ideally, the visit also brings together expertise that is currently spread over distinct TAILOR partners (scientific integration) and/or align different European AI initiatives (scientific alliance).


How to apply?
==========================================================================
## New call every 4 months

The **Collaboration Exchange Fund** uses a continuous open call. Every 4 months, proposals are ranked by an [international scientific board](https://tailor-network.eu/connectivity-fund/connectivity-fund-scientific-board/).

## What To Submit?

You should prepare a short proposal, as a single pdf including all appendices
(e.g. CV and invitation letter). Maximum length: 5 pages, 11 point, 1″ margins,
not including references/appendices. The single pdf document should be less than
10MB and can be submitted using the form following the button below.

[Button to Submit your proposal >>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyD7IxTXmPxgzuWF6XDggVdaUTYZ-PQiiUPnVZDh03OdxPBg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Proposal template

- Title, abstract, keywords, scientific area
- AI Excellence (max 4 pages)
  - Introduction: Significance of proposed research and prior work.
  - Methods: Detail the technical approach you have in mind.
  - Expected Results: Please include milestones with timeline estimates. This could include datasets, code release, tech reports, publications, presentations,...
- Impact: How will the visit impact you (e.g. your career) or the scientific community?
- Execution: Motivate your choice of host lab, visit duration, and starting date.
- Funds needed: Requested amount. Provide estimates of your main expenses. This calculation should be based on your own organisation's policy for travel expenses and per diem allowances.
- Additional information: Is there anything else that we should know about you (e.g. personal information), the host, or the proposed research?

You need to add the following in the appendices:

1. your Curriculum Vitae (CV), and
2. an invitation letter from your host stating that they will host you during the indicated period, and
3. a letter of support from your own organisation’s main TAILOR scientist (the name of that person can be found on the Partner page). The letter of support should clearly state that your own organisation will pay the costs related to the research visit using additional funding provided within the TAILOR project as a budget transfer between partners. You can find additional details of the payment in Section [Practical Organization](#practical-organization).

### What’s important?

Proposals will be evaluated on the following points, using the respective weigths.

- **AI Excellence** (25%). How does the visit contribute to Trustworthy AI?
- **Scientific track record** (25%). Your prior achievements, taking into account age and personal situation. 
- **Scientific step-up** (25%). How does the visit help you grow professionally and establish a worldwide reputation?
- **Suitability of the host** (12.5%). Is the host lab appropriate? Is it the best place to do the proposed research?
- **Suitability of the visit length** (12.5%). Is the visit length appropriate and realistic, also taking into account your personal and family situation?

During submission, you should choose at least three preferred evaluators for your proposal from the [scientific board](https://tailor-network.eu/connectivity-fund/connectivity-fund-scientific-board/). (The actual reviewers may be different as we aim to evenly distribute the evaluation load.)

## How Much?

We can support visits up to 15.000 EUR per proposal. We aim to support **20** visits over 2 years. The fund only covers travel, housing, and subsistence. The support is offered as a lump sum based on a cost estimate submitted beforehand. 60% of the lump sum will be paid at the start of the visit. The remaining 40% will be paid after the final report has been received and approved.

## Practical Organization

The support is offered as a budget transfer from the lead partner (LiU) to the sending organisation (the PhD-students home organisation) based on a cost estimate submitted beforehand. All costs related to the exchange must be paid directly by the sending organisation and declared to the EC as part of the regular reporting towards the EC.

The budget transfer will be effective after the submission of a scientific report at the end of the visit.
