# COLLABORATION EXCHANGE FUND
## For A Truly Vibrant Network Of Excellence

Deadlines any year: 15th March – 15th July – 15th November

## Boosting Connections Between TAILOR Members

The TAILOR network includes many of Europe’s top AI lab, and we want to reach out to the many other excellent labs and organizations across Europe to work together and create new breakthroughs in AI.

We especially aim to support young researchers to gain valuable experience and nurture the next generation of AI researchers.

## Research Visits

We support research visits between 1 and 12 months. We will pick up the bills so that you can focus on doing excellent AI. You and your host lab must belong to the TAILOR network.

## Great! Can I apply?

The collaboration exchange fund is open to all TAILOR member PhD students. You need to propose an AI research idea which can benefit from the collaboration of another TAILOR member lab. You should be invited by the host lab with a letter of recommendation.

## Research Visits Goals

For research visits, we are looking for visits that help young researchers gain experience and world-wide recognition by working in excellent labs (scientific step-up). Ideally, the visit also brings in expertise from outside the TAILOR network (scientific influx) and/or align different European AI initiatives (scientific alliance).

# How to apply

## New call every 4 months

The connectivity fund uses a continuous open call. Every 4 months, proposals are ranked by an international review committee.

## When

You can submit at any time. Proposals will be collected and ranked every year according to the following schedule. Latest possible submission is 15th of March 2023.

| Deadline for application\* | Start date workshop/visits | Notification  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------  |
| 15th March                 | 1st May or later           | 15th April    |

## What To Submit?

You should prepare a short proposal, as a single pdf including all appendices (e.g. CV and invitation letter). Maximum length: 5 pages, 11 point, 1″ margins, not including references/appendices. This single pdf-document should be submitted using Easychair. You may have to create Easychair account.

[Button to Submit your proposal >>](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=tailor-collab-2022-1)

### Proposal template

- Title, abstract, keywords, scientific area
- AI Excellence (max 4 pages)
  - Introduction: Significance of proposed research and prior work.
  - Methods: For research visits, detail the technical approach you have in mind. For workshops, detail who will attend (and why) and how participants will work together.
  - Expected Results: Please include milestones with timeline estimates. This could include datasets, code release, tech reports, publications, presentations,…
- Impact: How will the visit impact you (e.g. your career) or the scientific community?
- Execution: Motivate your choice of host lab, visit duration, and starting date.
- Funds needed: Requested amount. Provide estimates of your main expenses. Note the [maximum ‘per diem’ reimbursement amounts](https://tailor-network.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TAILOR_travel_rates.pdf?_ga=2.44618852.137512683.1666703251-1181339180.1666703251&_gl=1*1yfq1b6*_ga*MTE4MTMzOTE4MC4xNjY2NzAzMjUx*_ga_86QR8E54YE*MTY2Njc3NzU3NC4zLjEuMTY2Njc4MTI0NS4wLjAuMA..).
- Additional information: Is there anything else that we should know about you (e.g. personal information), the host, or the proposed research?

In the appendices, you need to submit your Curriculum Vitae (CV) and an invitation letter from your host stating that they will host you during the indicated period. This only applies to research visits.

### What’s important?

Proposals will be evaluated on the following points, using the respective weigths.

- **AI Excellence** (25%). How does the visit contribute to Trustworthy AI?
- **Scientific track record** (25%). Your prior achievements, taking into account age and personal situation. For workshops, this can include the track record of the participants or the community as a whole.
- **Scientific step-up** (25%). How does the visit help you grow professionally and establish a worldwide reputation? For workshops: how does the workshop help the participants?
- **Suitability of the host** (12.5%). Is the host lab (or workshop venue) appropriate? Is it the best place to do the proposed research?
- **Suitability of the visit length** (12.5%). Is the visit or workshop length appropriate and realistic, also taking into account your personal and family situation? If you plan to separate the research visit into multiple visits, clearly explain why this is necessary. This could either be for scientific or personal reasons (e.g. family commitments).

During submission, you can choose a preferred evaluator for your proposal from the scientific board. The actual reviewer may be different as we aim to evenly distribute the evaluation load.

## Who Can Apply? Where Can I Go?

All European AI researchers are eligible. You should be able to demonstrate that you work at a European lab and are active in AI through your publication record, or using other proof of involvement in AI research projects. You should be from a non-TAILOR lab and interested in visiting a TAILOR lab (see list below). Or, you should be from a TAILOR lab, and be invited by a non-TAILOR lab. Workshops can be hosted by either TAILOR or non-TAILOR labs, but only non-TAILOR attendants can receive funding.

Since the Connectivity Fund is a ‘Third Party Funding’ mechanism, we can only reimburse non-TAILOR participants. In practice, this means that, if you are from a non-TAILOR lab, you submit the application yourself. People working at a TAILOR lab can only be invited to visit a non-TAILOR lab, in which case the non-TAILOR lab needs to submit the application.

‘European’ countries means all EU and associated countries. Before submission, please check whether your lab is located in the EU or an EU associated country (see list).

In almost all cases, your own nationality is not important, but rather where the lab is located that will receive the funding for your research visit or workshop. That can be either your own lab or your host lab. As stated before, that lab should be a non-TAILOR lab to be able to recieve third party funding. Workshops funded by the connecticity fund (and hosted by non-TAILOR labs) can cover travel costs for people outside of Europe if they handle the reimbursements.

## How Much?

We can support visits and workshops up to 15.000 EUR per proposal. More could be requested given a really good motivation. We aim to support 100 visits/workshops over 3 years. The fund only covers travel, housing, and sustenance. The support is offered as a lump sum based on a cost estimate submitted beforehand. 60% of the lump sum will be paid at the start of the visit. The remaining 40% will be paid after the final report has been received and approved.

## Practical Organization

Connectivity Fund research visits and workshops are executed as financial support to third parties (FSTP), and only reimburses travel costs (by invoice). A Subgrant Agreement will be established between the institute of the applicant (e.g. a university or company) and the Eindhoven University of Technology, who manages the connectivity fund on behalf of the TAILOR Network of Excellence. The agreement is signed by representatives of both parties. We cannot fund individual people directly. A final budget and start and end dates of the research program are defined in the subgrant agreement. 60% of this budget can be requested by invoice before the start of the research visit or workshop. The remainder of the budget can be requested by a second invoice after the end of the visit or workshop, matching (only) the actual costs made. The recipient of the subgrant must ensure that proofs of actual costs are kept for the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) for a period of 5 years. Such costs can be actual proofs or per-diem allowances per local regulations of the recipient. Expenses are capped using the standard per diem rates for Dutch universities, and expenditures before or after the duration of the proposed research program are not eligible. As part of the subgrant, the recipient agrees to submit a final scientific report within 3 months after the end of the research program. For visits longer than 6 months, intermediate reports must be submitted every 6 months.

## TAILOR Labs?

Below is the full list of TAILOR labs you can visit, ordered by country. If you are from one of these labs, you can invite someone from a non-TAILOR lab to visit you, or be invited to visit a non-TAILOR lab.
